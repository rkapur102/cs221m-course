## Learning goals

#### 1. Introduction
 - Overview of course 

#### 2. Review of language models
 - Reviewing fundamentals of language models with an eye towards understaning their components
 - Autoregressive modeling - activations can only be affected by previous tokens
 - Residual stream, attention (moving information between tokens), and MLP (processing/recalling information)

#### 3. Behavioral analysis and input attribution
 - Minimal pairs for understanding model behavior
 - Input attribution - integrated gradients

#### 4. Probes for decoding activations
 - Survey probing methods: logit lens (pre-initialized probe), PCA (unsupervised), and supervised linear probes
 - Introduction to constructing interventions from probes (steering vectors)

#### 5. Interventions for steering activations
 - Survey different types of interventions an their respective goals
 - Iterative nullspace projection for erasing information
 - Interchange interventions for localizing representations
 - Representation fine-tuning for controlling model behavior

#### 6. Causal mediation analysis
 - Interchange interventions on minimal pairs for tracing information flow
 - Intervening on residual stream, individual attention heads
 - Tracing information flow in factual recall, reference resolution

#### 7. Theory of causal abstraction I
 - Theory of constructive abstraction
 - Example constructive abstraction in hierarchical equality task

#### 8. Designing counterfactuals
 - Guidelines for designing counterfactuals to target specific causal variables
 - Pointer-value mechanism in MCQA,
 - Multi-source interventions and entity vs. relation in RAVEL

#### 9. Automated causal interpretability
 - Introduction to distributed alignment search
 - Disentangling entity and relation in RAVEL

#### 10. Theory of causal abstraction II
 - Theory of abstraction under translation
 - Walkthrough example of DAS on hierarchical equality
